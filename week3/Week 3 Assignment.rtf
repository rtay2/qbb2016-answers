\f0\fs24 \cf0 We could not predict any effects because SNPEff is not backwards compatible (but it should be!). In the future, we could rerun all of our files using mm10 (although it would not be comparable to the results from the paper). If SNPEff had worked, the vcf file generated from FreeBayes would have had an appended column for the variant and the predicted effect. \

I left class not feeling satisfied - if only we could predict the effects! }
